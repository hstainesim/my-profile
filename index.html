              <h3> What define me ü§î</h3>
               <p> I'm passionate about football, I've been immersed in it since I was little and that's what allowed me to build strong social interactions. So that's where I derive the importance of friends in my life.</p>

               <h3> Football ‚öΩÔ∏è</h3>
               <p> As a Lille resident of LOSC and my favorite club, I was thrilled last season when they won league one. For me, football is cultural, it brings people's minds and hearts together. It's more than just a sport </p>
               <p>My favorite player are : </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> <em>Lionel Messi</em> currently playing at PSG </li>
                     <li> <em>Jonathan David</em> playing as a triker for the LOSC </li>
                      </ul>
               <p>No one can ever beat Lionel in my heart, I love this guy. It's the GOAT of football.</p>

               <h3>Friends ü•∞ </h3>
               <p>hanks to my social interactions with my friends I learn to adapt my speech as well as my behavior, essential in management. In addition, we can discuss subjective subjects in order to build a real opinion based on the facts presented to us. I learn a lot from my friends whether it's over a drink or during a movie outing.</p>
